                        <p>
                            Pushp Brand Spices was founded by Late Shri Kishanlalaji Surana in 1974 as a small-scale
                            industry in Indore, the heart of central India.
                            From being a family-owned business that catered solely to the Malwa region, the company
                            since its inception has grown dynamically, not only to become a professionally managed
                            group of companies but also to cater to the vast Indian market.
